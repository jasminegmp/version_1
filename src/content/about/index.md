Hello! My name is Jasmine and I'm a software developer based in Orange County, California.
I am an ambitious, hardworking individual with a background in computer science, more specifically firmware and data mining. I am also an artist by heart and have a strong passion for the field of visual designs. 

I worked for 6 years before pausing my career in 2019 in order to pursue my interest in front end design and web development!

Here are a few technologies I've been working with most recently:
- Javascript
- React
- HTML, CSS, SCSS
